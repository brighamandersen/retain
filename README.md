### Description of project

### Motivation for project

I wanted to have a good, solid crud application that I can show off. I also wanted to practice using Express as a backend, and Prisma as an ORM, then having that API interface with a React front end.

### Learnings

This was one of my first projects of trying out CSS modules. They are nice, but for the scope of my small project I just found that it was creating more organizational work with creating a bunch of separate styling files for each component. I switched over to just using a global stylesheet given the small size of the project and how many of the styles could be reused across components. I could see the use case for CSS Modules for a larger project, especially one with multiple active developers.
